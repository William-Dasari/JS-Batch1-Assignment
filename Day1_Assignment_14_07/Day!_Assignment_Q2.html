This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window<br>var variables can be redeclared<br>Syntax: var name = any value <br><br><br>");

A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly braces is a block.its is local variable <br>Example :let n=12<br> n=123<br><br><br>");
